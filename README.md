# Cancer-Chatbot
Cancer is a complex disease that can be difficult to understand. This project develops a chatbot that can answer questions about cancer using a large language model (LLM). The LLM is trained on a dataset of cancer-related text, so it can answer a some range of questions about cancer.
# Problem Statement
Cancer is a deadly disease that can be difficult to understand. This can be especially true for patients who are newly diagnosed or who are seeking information about treatment options. There is a need for a reliable and accessible source of information about cancer that can be easily understood by patients.
# Goals and Objectives
Develop a chatbot that can answer questions about cancer.

Train the LLM model on a pdf dataset of cancer-related text.
